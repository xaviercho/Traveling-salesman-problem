SEARCHING THE CHEAPEST PATH algol: so the algorithm that was created searches by row and 
stores an initial data as a starter which is anderson(284) then from there compares the data of that row to find the cheaper path, 
then it makes that the city you are going, and makes that the index as your next visit, unless you have visited it already.

HOW TO WORK THE CODE

-the csv files has to be in the same folder stored as the program files
go to driver.java file run it, the first regular case is already set, so all you have to do is run the program once you have set the files in the correct folder.

-to switch files, copy and paste the other csv files below on lines (34-36) to try them 
**makes sure that they have ".csv" at the end and also make sure in the quotes that there is no spaces at the end 
 or else the program wont find the file.

copy and paste then run to see results if you are too lazy the results are captured via JPEG files in the folder given.
